              <p class='card-text'><b>Betterbnb</b> A web application that provides booking website users a more complete and honest view of the listings being recommended to them. Users are provided 
              with crime statistics, notable nearby attractions, weather information, population statistics, and nearby lodging. This will allow users to make a more informed decision when using a

              <p class='card-text'><b>PaperBot</b> A web application that allows users to create educational paper trading bots. Users are able to configure certain events that could set off a buy or 
              a sell order such as if a specific term is trending on twitter. This gives users the ability to create a trading algorithm from scratch and use what they learn from it to make more 
              informed decisions about the stock market.</p>

              <p class='card-text'><b>Budger Manager</b> A group project made during Purdue's BoilerMake Hackathon. We wanted to create a tool for students to effectively manage their finances. 
              This application allows users to track their monthly spending. It also creates personalized spending goals so that users can save money to buy items that they add to their "wishlist".</p>

              <p class='card-text'><b>SafeWalk</b> Worked with the Purdue Police Department to develop a mobile application that modernizes the Purdue safe-walk program to make it more accessible for 
              students. When requesting the SafeWalk service, students can simply share their location through the mobile application instead of having to describe it over the phone.</p>
